 Path planning is basically a combination of Behaviour Planning, Prediction and Trajectory Planning.

- Behavior Planner :
	Takes input the Map, Route to destination & Predictions about what other static and dynamic obstacles are likely to do and produces output, the 
	suggested maneuver for the vehicle which the trajectory planner is responsible for reaching collision-free, smooth and safe.

	***
	The Prediction model updates with a higher frequency compared to Behavior.
	The Trajectory Planner upates with a higher frequency compared to Prediction.
	***

	Responsibilities :
	- Suggest states/maneuvers which are,
		Feasible
		Safe
		Legal

	1. Finite State Machines :
		It makes decisions based on finite set of discrete states.
		There can be transitions from one state to many others and also from one state to itself i.e. Self-Transition.
		There can be states with no transitions to other states i.e. Accepting State.
		
		This takes a Input( Map, Predictions, Speed limit, Localization data, Current state ) which is then passed to the Transition function 
		which uses the input to decide on the transition to make next.
		
		Ex. states for a SDC on a Highway
			- Keep Lane	: stay on the lane
			- Change Lane Right / Left	: move right/left
			- Prepare Lane change right/ left : attempt to match position and speed of the gap in lane, activate turning signal

		The decisions to the states can be made based on `Cost Functions`.
		ex.
		- speed cost
		- lane cost
			
- Trajectory Generation
	- Configuration Space : representation of robot in a world.
	- Algorithm properties :
		Completeness
		Optimality
